Google Clone

This project involves designing a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The main goal is to create a user interface that resembles Google's aesthetics and functionality.

Features:

Three pages: The project requires three pages - index.html for regular Google Search, a page for Google Image Search, and a page for Google Advanced Search.
Navigation links: Each page should have a link in the upper-right corner to navigate back to the Google Search page. The Google Search page should have links to Image Search and Advanced Search.
Search functionality: On the Google Search page, users should be able to enter a query, click the "Google Search" button, and be directed to the Google search results for that query.
Design and layout: The search bar and search button should be centered with rounded corners, similar to Google's interface.
Google Image Search: The Image Search page should allow users to enter a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results.
Google Advanced Search: The Advanced Search page should include input fields for four search options: "all these words," "this exact word or phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words." The layout should resemble Google's Advanced Search page.
Advanced Search functionality: Clicking the "Advanced Search" button on the Advanced Search page should direct users to the search results page for their query.
"I'm Feeling Lucky" button: The main Google Search page should include an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that takes users directly to the first Google search result for their query, bypassing the normal results page.
